        // 3. Change your code to assign the value 3.14159 to myString. What happens?
            //-it created an error

        // 5. Change your code to assign the value 3.14 to myNumber. What do you notice?
            //-type error

        // 6. Change your code to assign the value 123L (Note the 'L' at the end) to myNumber.
            //-it works...

        // 7. Change your code to assign the value 123 to myNumber.

        // 8. Why does assigning the value 3.14 to a variable declared as a long not compile, but assigning an integer value does?
            //because 3.14 is a float and long requires an int

        // 9. Change your code to declare myNumber as a float. Assign the value 3.14 to it. What happens? What are two ways we could fix this?
            // -it errors, add f at the end or change it to a double

        // 10. Copy and paste the following code blocks one at a time and execute them
